        Each machinist is responsible for inspecting their own work before it
        moves to the next stage. This promotes accountability and ensures that
        issues are caught at the source.
      </>,
      <>
        Parts are not permitted to advance unless they meet the required stage
        specifications. Critical dimensions are measured using specialised
        equipment. These are then documented and must be approved to maintain
        consistent quality.

      <>
        Every step of the production process is tracked and recorded, including
        who inspected each part and when. This provides complete traceability,
        maintains process transparency, and enables root-cause analysis if
        required.

        Final reports are available for every completed part or job, offering
        customers full visibility and confidence in the quality of their order.

    paragraphs: [
      <>
        After passing through all manufacturing stages, every part goes through
        a dedicated final quality check at our quality control department. This
        inspection acts as a final safeguard against any inconsistencies or
        defects that may have escaped earlier detection.
      </>,
      <>
        Final inspection reports are generated for each job, verifying that
        every component meets customer specifications before delivery.
